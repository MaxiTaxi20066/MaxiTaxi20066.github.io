    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>The way I learnt was in a pair (my partner and I switched coding every 5 or so minutes).
I think this was an effective strategy because we both had a chance to do everything.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>The thing that most limited my learning was that my partner and I were messing around with the different colours of the font and the background a bit too long.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
