    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>The way that I learnt this week was by having my partner do most of the coding while I did most of the circuitry. Also my partner and I switched roles every so often so we both did the same amount of everything.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Some of the things that limited my learning were that the pair working next to us were having difficulties turning their fuze box on for about ten minutes. Also the pictures in the FUZE Basic book didn't show us where to put some of the electronic components.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that I will change for next time is that I will try to do a lot more coding rather than doing more circuitry.</td>
