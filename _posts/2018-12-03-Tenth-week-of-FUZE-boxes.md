    <td>Some of the things that limited my learning were that my partner did not do the same amount of coding as me because he wanted to control the arm more than he probably should have..</td>

    <td>The thing that I will change for next time is that I need to do the same amount of work as my partner or be more strict and say that he needs to let me have more time to do coding.</td>
