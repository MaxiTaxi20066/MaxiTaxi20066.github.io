    <td>The way that I learnt this week was by doing some of the coding and most of the circuitry on the FUZE boxes. This was quite affective and my partner and I got quite far.</td>

    <td>Some of the things that limited my learning were that my partner and I didn't do the same amount of work for each section which was the coding and the circuitry.</td>
